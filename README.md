## Lab Questions

### Compare and contrast One Hot and Binary encodings

Each category is a vector for one hot, and for binary, it is a binary number. Hot has a hgih
space complexity and binary has a low.

### Which method did your team find easier, and why?

We found one hot to be easier. It was easier to solve the next equations than it
was for the binary encoder.

### In what conditions would you have to use one over the other? Think about resource utilization on the FPGA.

Choose hot encoding when the categories are small and not constrained. Choose binary when categories are large and there are constraints.
